This is signed, at the end, Ralph Davis, March 8, 1705.  It was followed very shortly by a completer account, written after the execution, and entitled:
	The Northamptonshire Witches, Being a true and faithful account of the Births, Educations, Lives, and Conversations of Elinor Shaw and Mary Philips (The two notorious Witches) That were executed at Northampton on Saturday, March the 17th, 1705with their full Confession to the Minister, and last Dying Speeches at the place of Execution, the like never before heard of.Communicated in a Letter last Post, from Mr. Ralph Davis of Northampton, to Mr. William Simons, Merchantt in London, London, 1705.
	With these two pamphlets we wish to compare another, which was apparently published in 1716 and was entitled: The Whole Trial and Examination of Mrs. Mary Hicks and her Daughter Elizabeth, But of Nine Years of Age, who were Condemnd the last Assizes held at Huntingdon for Witchcraft, and there Executed on Saturday, the 28th of July 1716the like never heard before; their Behaviour with several Divines who came to converse with em whilst under their sentence of Death; and last Dying Speeches and Confession at the place of execution, London, 1716.  There is a copy in the Bodleian Library.
	The two Northamptonshire pamphlets and the Huntingdonshire pamphlet have been set by themselves because they appear to have been written by one hand.  Moreover, it looks very much as if they were downright fabrications foisted upon the public by a man who had already in 1700 made to order an unhistorical pamphlet.  To show this, it will be necessary to review briefly the facts about the Worcester pamphlet described above, 4.  What seems to be the second edition of a pamphlet entitle The full Trualls, Examinations and Condemnations of Four Notorious Witches, At the Assizes held at Worchester on Tuesday the 4th of March, was published at London with the date 1700.  It purports to tell the story of one of the cases that came up during Matthew Hopkins career in 1645-1647.  It has been universally accepted  even by Thomas Wright, Ashton, W. H. D. Adams, and Inderwick.  An examination shows, however, that it was made over from the Chelmsford pamphlet of 1645.  The author shows little ingenuity, for he steals not only the confessions of four witches at the trial, but their names as well.  Rebecca West, Margaret Landis, Susan Cock, and Rose Hallybread had all been hanged at Chelmsford and could hardly have been rehanged at Worcester.  Practically all that the writer of the Worcester pamphlet did was to touch over the confessions and add thrilling details about their executions.
	Now, it looks very much as if the same writer had composed the Northamptonshire pamphlets of 1705 and the Huntingdonshire pamphlets of 1716.  The verbal resemblance are nothing less than remarkable.  The Worcester pamphlet, in its title, tells of their Confessions and Last Dying Speeches at the palce of execution.  The second of the two Northamptonshire pamphlets (the first was issued before the execution) speaks of their full Confession to the Minister, and last Dying Speeches at the place of Execution.  The Huntingdonshire pamphlet closes the title with last Dying Speeches and Confession at the place of Execution.  The Worcester pamphlet uses the phrase with other amazing Particulars; the Northamptonshire pamphlet the phrase the particulars of their amazing Pranks.  The Huntingdon pamphlet has in this case no similar phrase but the Huntingdon and Northamptonshire pamphlets have another phrase in common.  The Northamptonshire pamphlet says: the like never before heard of; the Huntingdon pamphlet says; the like never heard before.
	These resemblances are in the titles.  The Northampton and the fabricated Worcester pamphlets show other similarities in their accounts.  The Notrhampton women were so hardened in their Wickedness that they Publickly boaster that their Master (meaning the Devil) would not suffer them to be Executed but they found him a Lyer.  The Worcester writer speaks of the Devil who told them to the Last that he would secure them from Publick Punishment, but now too late they found him a Lyer as he was from the beginning of the World.  In concluding their narratives the Northamptonshire and Worcestershire pamphleteers show an interesting similarity of treatment.  The Northampton witches made a howling and lamentable noise on receiving their sentences, the Worcester women and a yelling and howling at their executions.
	These resemblances may be fairly characterized as striking.  If it be asked whether the phrases quotes are not conventional in witch pamphlets, the answer must be in the negative.  So far as the writer knows, these phrases occur in no other of the fifty or more witch pamphlets.  The word notorious, which occurs in the titles of the Worcester and Northampton pamphlets, is a common one and would signify nothing.  The other phrases mentioned are characteristic and distinctive.  This similarity suggests that the three pamphlets were written by the same hand.  Since we know that one of the three is a fabrication, we are led to suspect the credibility of the other two.
	There are, indeed, other reasons for doubting the historicity of these two.  A close scrutiny of the Northampton pamphlet shows that the witchcrafts there described have the peculiar characteristics of the witchcrafts in the palmy days of Matthew Hopkins and that the wording of the descriptions is much the same.  The Northampton pamphlet tells of a tall black man, who appeared to the two women.  A tall black man had appeared to Rebecca West at Chelmsford in 1645.  A much more important point is that the prisoners at Northampton had been watched at night in order to keep their imps from coming in.  This night-watching was a process that had never, so far as our records go, been used since the Hopkins alarm, of which it had been the characteristic feature.  Were there no other resemblance between the Northampton cases and those at Chelmsford, this similarity would also lead us to suspect the credibility of the Northampton pamphlet.  Unfortunately the indiscreet writer of the Northampton narrative lets other phrases belonging to 1645 creep into his account.
	When the Northampton women were watched, a little white thing about the bigness of a Cat had appeared.  But a which thing about the Bignesse of a Cat had appeared to the watchers at Chelmsford in 1645.  This is not all.  The Northampton witches are said to have killed their victims by roasting and pricking images, a charge which had once been common, but which, so far as the writer can recall, had not been used since the Somerset cases at 1663.  It was a charge very commonly used against the Chelmsford witches whom Matthew Hopkins prosecuted.  Moreover the Northampton witches boasted that their Master would not suffer them to be executed.  No Chelmsford witch had made that boast; but Mr. Lowes, who was executed with that at Chelmsford, so closely that the writer who had read of one would probably had read of the other), had declared that he had a charm to keep him from the gallows.
	It will be seen that these are close resemblances both in characteristic feature and in wording.  But the most perfect resemblance is in a confession.  The two Northampton women describing their imps  creatures, by the way, that had figured largely in the Hopkins trials  said that if the Imps were not constantly imployd to do Mischief, they [the witches] had not their healths; but when they were imployd they were very Heathful and Well.  This was almost exactly what Anne Leech had confessed at Chelmsford.  Her words were: And that when This Examinant did not send and employ them abroad to do mischief, she had not her health, but when they were imployd, she was healthful and well.<BR><BR>  <B>Page Number 3</B> : 375-379<BR><BR> <H3>Events Number 19:</H3>  <B>Event Short Description</B> : <A href="javascript:showIndividualCard('events',1392)">Rebecca West confesses to commanding imps to kill a horse, cow, and a child (Anonymous 193).

The Northamptonshire pamphlet says: the like never before heard of; the Huntingdon pamphlet says; the like never heard before.
	These resemblances are in the titles.  The Northampton and the fabricated Worcester pamphlets show other similarities in their accounts.  The Notrhampton women were so hardened in their Wickedness that they Publickly boaster that their Master (meaning the Devil) would not suffer them to be Executed but they found him a Lyer.  The Worcester writer speaks of the Devil who told them to the Last that he would secure them from Publick Punishment, but now too late they found him a Lyer as he was from the beginning of the World.  In concluding their narratives the Northamptonshire and Worcestershire pamphleteers show an interesting similarity of treatment.  The Northampton witches made a howling and lamentable noise on receiving their sentences, the Worcester women and a yelling and howling at their executions.
	These resemblances may be fairly characterized as striking.  If it be asked whether the phrases quotes are not conventional in witch pamphlets, the answer must be in the negative.  So far as the writer knows, these phrases occur in no other of the fifty or more witch pamphlets.  The word notorious, which occurs in the titles of the Worcester and Northampton pamphlets, is a common one and would signify nothing.  The other phrases mentioned are characteristic and distinctive.  This similarity suggests that the three pamphlets were written by the same hand.  Since we know that one of the three is a fabrication, we are led to suspect the credibility of the other two.
	There are, indeed, other reasons for doubting the historicity of these two.  A close scrutiny of the Northampton pamphlet shows that the witchcrafts there described have the peculiar characteristics of the witchcrafts in the palmy days of Matthew Hopkins and that the wording of the descriptions is much the same.  The Northampton pamphlet tells of a tall black man, who appeared to the two women.  A tall black man had appeared to Rebecca West at Chelmsford in 1645.  A much more important point is that the prisoners at Northampton had been watched at night in order to keep their imps from coming in.  This night-watching was a process that had never, so far as our records go, been used since the Hopkins alarm, of which it had been the characteristic feature.  Were there no other resemblance between the Northampton cases and those at Chelmsford, this similarity would also lead us to suspect the credibility of the Northampton pamphlet.  Unfortunately the indiscreet writer of the Northampton narrative lets other phrases belonging to 1645 creep into his account.
	When the Northampton women were watched, a little white thing about the bigness of a Cat had appeared.  But a which thing about the Bignesse of a Cat had appeared to the watchers at Chelmsford in 1645.  This is not all.  The Northampton witches are said to have killed their victims by roasting and pricking images, a charge which had once been common, but which, so far as the writer can recall, had not been used since the Somerset cases at 1663.  It was a charge very commonly used against the Chelmsford witches whom Matthew Hopkins prosecuted.  Moreover the Northampton witches boasted that their Master would not suffer them to be executed.  No Chelmsford witch had made that boast; but Mr. Lowes, who was executed with that at Chelmsford, so closely that the writer who had read of one would probably had read of the other), had declared that he had a charm to keep him from the gallows.
	It will be seen that these are close resemblances both in characteristic feature and in wording.  But the most perfect resemblance is in a confession.  The two Northampton women describing their imps  creatures, by the way, that had figured largely in the Hopkins trials  said that if the Imps were not constantly imployd to do Mischief, they [the witches] had not their healths; but when they were imployd they were very Heathful and Well.  This was almost exactly what Anne Leech had confessed at Chelmsford.  Her words were: And that when This Examinant did not send and employ them abroad to do mischief, she had not her health, but when they were imployd, she was healthful and well.<BR><BR>  <B>Page Number 2</B> : 375-379<BR><BR> <H3>Events Number 20:</H3>  <B>Event Short Description</B> : <A href="javascript:showIndividualCard('events',1393)">Rebecca West claims that, because Mother Benefield questioned her ability to keep their gathering of witches a secret, she was instructed to deny God and Jesus Christ.

This is signed, at the end, Ralph Davis, March 8, 1705.  It was followed very shortly by a completer account, written after the execution, and entitled:
	The Northamptonshire Witches, Being a true and faithful account of the Births, Educations, Lives, and Conversations of Elinor Shaw and Mary Philips (The two notorious Witches) That were executed at Northampton on Saturday, March the 17th, 1705with their full Confession to the Minister, and last Dying Speeches at the place of Execution, the like never before heard of.Communicated in a Letter last Post, from Mr. Ralph Davis of Northampton, to Mr. William Simons, Merchantt in London, London, 1705.
	With these two pamphlets we wish to compare another, which was apparently published in 1716 and was entitled: The Whole Trial and Examination of Mrs. Mary Hicks and her Daughter Elizabeth, But of Nine Years of Age, who were Condemnd the last Assizes held at Huntingdon for Witchcraft, and there Executed on Saturday, the 28th of July 1716the like never heard before; their Behaviour with several Divines who came to converse with em whilst under their sentence of Death; and last Dying Speeches and Confession at the place of execution, London, 1716.  There is a copy in the Bodleian Library.
	The two Northamptonshire pamphlets and the Huntingdonshire pamphlet have been set by themselves because they appear to have been written by one hand.  Moreover, it looks very much as if they were downright fabrications foisted upon the public by a man who had already in 1700 made to order an unhistorical pamphlet.  To show this, it will be necessary to review briefly the facts about the Worcester pamphlet described above, 4.  What seems to be the second edition of a pamphlet entitle The full Trualls, Examinations and Condemnations of Four Notorious Witches, At the Assizes held at Worchester on Tuesday the 4th of March, was published at London with the date 1700.  It purports to tell the story of one of the cases that came up during Matthew Hopkins career in 1645-1647.  It has been universally accepted  even by Thomas Wright, Ashton, W. H. D. Adams, and Inderwick.  An examination shows, however, that it was made over from the Chelmsford pamphlet of 1645.  The author shows little ingenuity, for he steals not only the confessions of four witches at the trial, but their names as well.  Rebecca West, Margaret Landis, Susan Cock, and Rose Hallybread had all been hanged at Chelmsford and could hardly have been rehanged at Worcester.  Practically all that the writer of the Worcester pamphlet did was to touch over the confessions and add thrilling details about their executions.
	Now, it looks very much as if the same writer had composed the Northamptonshire pamphlets of 1705 and the Huntingdonshire pamphlets of 1716.  The verbal resemblance are nothing less than remarkable.  The Worcester pamphlet, in its title, tells of their Confessions and Last Dying Speeches at the palce of execution.  The second of the two Northamptonshire pamphlets (the first was issued before the execution) speaks of their full Confession to the Minister, and last Dying Speeches at the place of Execution.  The Huntingdonshire pamphlet closes the title with last Dying Speeches and Confession at the place of Execution.  The Worcester pamphlet uses the phrase with other amazing Particulars; the Northamptonshire pamphlet the phrase the particulars of their amazing Pranks.  The Huntingdon pamphlet has in this case no similar phrase but the Huntingdon and Northamptonshire pamphlets have another phrase in common.  The Northamptonshire pamphlet says: the like never before heard of; the Huntingdon pamphlet says; the like never heard before.
	These resemblances are in the titles.  The Northampton and the fabricated Worcester pamphlets show other similarities in their accounts.

This is signed, at the end, Ralph Davis, March 8, 1705.  It was followed very shortly by a completer account, written after the execution, and entitled:
	The Northamptonshire Witches, Being a true and faithful account of the Births, Educations, Lives, and Conversations of Elinor Shaw and Mary Philips (The two notorious Witches) That were executed at Northampton on Saturday, March the 17th, 1705with their full Confession to the Minister, and last Dying Speeches at the place of Execution, the like never before heard of.Communicated in a Letter last Post, from Mr. Ralph Davis of Northampton, to Mr. William Simons, Merchantt in London, London, 1705.
	With these two pamphlets we wish to compare another, which was apparently published in 1716 and was entitled: The Whole Trial and Examination of Mrs. Mary Hicks and her Daughter Elizabeth, But of Nine Years of Age, who were Condemnd the last Assizes held at Huntingdon for Witchcraft, and there Executed on Saturday, the 28th of July 1716the like never heard before; their Behaviour with several Divines who came to converse with em whilst under their sentence of Death; and last Dying Speeches and Confession at the place of execution, London, 1716.  There is a copy in the Bodleian Library.
	The two Northamptonshire pamphlets and the Huntingdonshire pamphlet have been set by themselves because they appear to have been written by one hand.  Moreover, it looks very much as if they were downright fabrications foisted upon the public by a man who had already in 1700 made to order an unhistorical pamphlet.  To show this, it will be necessary to review briefly the facts about the Worcester pamphlet described above, 4.  What seems to be the second edition of a pamphlet entitle The full Trualls, Examinations and Condemnations of Four Notorious Witches, At the Assizes held at Worchester on Tuesday the 4th of March, was published at London with the date 1700.  It purports to tell the story of one of the cases that came up during Matthew Hopkins career in 1645-1647.  It has been universally accepted  even by Thomas Wright, Ashton, W. H. D. Adams, and Inderwick.  An examination shows, however, that it was made over from the Chelmsford pamphlet of 1645.  The author shows little ingenuity, for he steals not only the confessions of four witches at the trial, but their names as well.  Rebecca West, Margaret Landis, Susan Cock, and Rose Hallybread had all been hanged at Chelmsford and could hardly have been rehanged at Worcester.  Practically all that the writer of the Worcester pamphlet did was to touch over the confessions and add thrilling details about their executions.
	Now, it looks very much as if the same writer had composed the Northamptonshire pamphlets of 1705 and the Huntingdonshire pamphlets of 1716.  The verbal resemblance are nothing less than remarkable.  The Worcester pamphlet, in its title, tells of their Confessions and Last Dying Speeches at the palce of execution.  The second of the two Northamptonshire pamphlets (the first was issued before the execution) speaks of their full Confession to the Minister, and last Dying Speeches at the place of Execution.  The Huntingdonshire pamphlet closes the title with last Dying Speeches and Confession at the place of Execution.  The Worcester pamphlet uses the phrase with other amazing Particulars; the Northamptonshire pamphlet the phrase the particulars of their amazing Pranks.  The Huntingdon pamphlet has in this case no similar phrase but the Huntingdon and Northamptonshire pamphlets have another phrase in common.  The Northamptonshire pamphlet says: the like never before heard of; the Huntingdon pamphlet says; the like never heard before.
	These resemblances are in the titles.  The Northampton and the fabricated Worcester pamphlets show other similarities in their accounts.  The Notrhampton women were so hardened in their Wickedness that they Publickly boaster that their Master (meaning the Devil) would not suffer them to be Executed but they found him a Lyer.  The Worcester writer speaks of the Devil who told them to the Last that he would secure them from Publick Punishment, but now too late they found him a Lyer as he was from the beginning of the World.  In concluding their narratives the Northamptonshire and Worcestershire pamphleteers show an interesting similarity of treatment.  The Northampton witches made a howling and lamentable noise on receiving their sentences, the Worcester women and a yelling and howling at their executions.
	These resemblances may be fairly characterized as striking.  If it be asked whether the phrases quotes are not conventional in witch pamphlets, the answer must be in the negative.  So far as the writer knows, these phrases occur in no other of the fifty or more witch pamphlets.  The word notorious, which occurs in the titles of the Worcester and Northampton pamphlets, is a common one and would signify nothing.  The other phrases mentioned are characteristic and distinctive.  This similarity suggests that the three pamphlets were written by the same hand.  Since we know that one of the three is a fabrication, we are led to suspect the credibility of the other two.
	There are, indeed, other reasons for doubting the historicity of these two.  A close scrutiny of the Northampton pamphlet shows that the witchcrafts there described have the peculiar characteristics of the witchcrafts in the palmy days of Matthew Hopkins and that the wording of the descriptions is much the same.  The Northampton pamphlet tells of a tall black man, who appeared to the two women.  A tall black man had appeared to Rebecca West at Chelmsford in 1645.  A much more important point is that the prisoners at Northampton had been watched at night in order to keep their imps from coming in.  This night-watching was a process that had never, so far as our records go, been used since the Hopkins alarm, of which it had been the characteristic feature.  Were there no other resemblance between the Northampton cases and those at Chelmsford, this similarity would also lead us to suspect the credibility of the Northampton pamphlet.  Unfortunately the indiscreet writer of the Northampton narrative lets other phrases belonging to 1645 creep into his account.
	When the Northampton women were watched, a little white thing about the bigness of a Cat had appeared.  But a which thing about the Bignesse of a Cat had appeared to the watchers at Chelmsford in 1645.  This is not all.  The Northampton witches are said to have killed their victims by roasting and pricking images, a charge which had once been common, but which, so far as the writer can recall, had not been used since the Somerset cases at 1663.  It was a charge very commonly used against the Chelmsford witches whom Matthew Hopkins prosecuted.  Moreover the Northampton witches boasted that their Master would not suffer them to be executed.  No Chelmsford witch had made that boast; but Mr. Lowes, who was executed with that at Chelmsford, so closely that the writer who had read of one would probably had read of the other), had declared that he had a charm to keep him from the gallows.
	It will be seen that these are close resemblances both in characteristic feature and in wording.  But the most perfect resemblance is in a confession.  The two Northampton women describing their imps  creatures, by the way, that had figured largely in the Hopkins trials  said that if the Imps were not constantly imployd to do Mischief, they [the witches] had not their healths; but when they were imployd they were very Heathful and Well.  This was almost exactly what Anne Leech had confessed at Chelmsford.  Her words were: And that when This Examinant did not send and employ them abroad to do mischief, she had not her health, but when they were imployd, she was healthful and well.<BR><BR>  <B>Page Number 2</B> : 375-379<BR><BR> <H3>Events Number 23:</H3>  <B>Event Short Description</B> : <A href="javascript:showIndividualCard('events',1396)">Rebecca West claims that, on her way to the Grand Inquest, she informed Mother Miller that she would tell the Inquest nothing, even if they pulled her to pieces with pincers.
